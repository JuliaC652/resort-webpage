#### _Demonstration Web Site For A Resort_

## Technologies Used

* _Computer_
* _Web Browser_

## Description

_This was a practice Website created as an exercise from www.learnhowtoprogram.com. The site consists of five pages that incorporate elements of previous lessons-- HTML basics, CSS stylesheets, Git branching and merging, linking webpages, sourcing images (and I elected to instert span/hovertext over each picture)._

_Now the Rich and the Lawless can easily navigate this resort website to evade justice when even their bribe money can't hide the crimes they've committed!_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Computer_
* _Web Browser_
* _GitHub_

_Navigate to Github.com/JuliaC652/resort-webpage and download the contents (ensure that the folders for images and css stylesheets are downloaded too). Open the folder and click on any .html document. Navigate the site on your web browser!_

## Known Bugs

* _Boy Is This Site Ugly_
* _You Are Likely Too Poor For This Resort_
* _And the Resort Does Not Exist_
